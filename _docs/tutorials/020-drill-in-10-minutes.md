## Objective

Use Apache Drill to query sample data in 10 minutes. For simplicity, youâ€™ll
run Drill in _embedded_ mode rather than _distributed_ mode to try out Drill
without having to perform any setup tasks.

## Installation Overview

You can install Drill in embedded mode on a machine running Linux, Mac OS X, or Windows. For information about installing Drill in distributed mode, see [Installing Drill in Distributed Mode]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/installing-drill-in-distributed-mode).

This installation procedure includes how to download the Apache Drill archive and extract the contents to a directory on your machine. The Apache Drill archive contains sample JSON and Parquet files that you can query immediately.

After installing Drill, you start the Drill shell. The Drill shell is a pure-Java console-based utility for connecting to relational databases and executing SQL commands. Drill follows the ANSI SQL: 2011 standard with [extensions]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/sql-extensions/) for nested data formats and other capabilities.

## Embedded Mode Installation Prerequisites

You need to meet the following prerequisites to run Drill:

* Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows: [Oracle Java SE Development (JDK) Kit 7](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html) installation
* Windows only:
  * A JAVA_HOME environment variable set up that points to  to the JDK installation
  * A PATH environment variable that includes a pointer to the JDK installation
  * A third-party utility for unzipping a tar.gz file

### Java Installation Prerequisite Check

Run the following command in a terminal (Linux and Mac OS X) or Command Prompt (Windows) to verify that Java 7 is the version in effect:

    java -version

The output looks something like this:

    java version "1.7.0_79"
    Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_7965-b15)
    Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 24.79-b02, mixed mode)

## Install Drill on Linux or Mac OS X

Complete the following steps to install Drill:

1. In a terminal window, navigate (cd) to the directory where you want to install Drill.

2. Issue one of the following two commands (some systems will have wget, and
some will have curl) to download the latest version of Apache Drill, or download Drill from the [Drill web site](http://getdrill.org/drill/download/apache-drill-1.0.0.tar.gz):

        wget http://getdrill.org/drill/download/apache-drill-1.0.0.tar.gz

OR

        curl -o apache-drill-1.0.0.tar.gz http://getdrill.org/drill/download/apache-drill-1.0.0.tar.gz

3. Extract the contents of the Drill tar.gz file. Use sudo if necessary:

        sudo tar -xvzf apache-drill-1.0.0.tar.gz

The extraction process creates the installation directory named apache-drill-1.0.0 containing the Drill software.

At this point, you can start Drill.

## Start Drill on Linux and Mac OS X
Start Drill in embedded mode using the `drill-embedded` command:

1. Navigate to the Drill installation directory. For example:

        cd apache-drill-1.0.0

2. Issue the following command to launch Drill in embedded mode:

        bin/drill-embedded

   This starts *sqlline*, the command-line environment provided with Drill,
   which supports submitting queries directly from a terminal. The message of
   the day, followed by the `0: jdbc:drill:zk=local>` prompt appears.

   NOTE TO DOCWRITERS: I tried this on 0.9.0 (because 1.0.0 isn't available
   yet), and there is no bin/drill-embedded. In order to start it up, I had
   to issue

        bin/sqlline -u jdbc:drill:zk=local

   At this point, you can [submit queries]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/drill-in-10-minutes#query-sample-data) to Drill.

### Install Drill on Windows

You can install Drill on Windows 7 or 8. First, set the JAVA_HOME environment variable, and then install Drill. Complete the following steps to install Drill:

1. Click the following link to download the latest version of Apache Drill:  [http://getdrill.org/drill/download/apache-drill-1.0.0.tar.gz](http://getdrill.org/drill/download/apache-drill-0.1.0.tar.gz)
2. Move the `apache-drill-1.0.0.tar.gz` file to a directory where you want to install Drill.
3. Unzip the `TAR.GZ` file using a third-party tool. If the tool you use does not unzip the TAR file as well as the `TAR.GZ` file, unzip the `apache-drill-1.0.0.tar` to extract the Drill software. The extraction process creates the installation directory named apache-drill-1.0.0 containing the Drill software. For example:
   ![drill install dir]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/img/drill-directory.png)

At this point, you can start Drill.

## Start Drill on Windows
Start Drill by running the sqlline.bat file and typing a connection string, as shown in the following procedure. The `zk=local` in the connection string means the local node is the ZooKeeper node:

1. Open the apache-drill-1.0.0 folder.
2. Open the bin folder, and double-click the `sqlline.bat` file:
   ![drill bin dir]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/img/drill-bin.png)
   The Windows command prompt opens.
3. At the sqlline> prompt, type `!connect jdbc:drill:zk=local` and then press Enter:
   ![sqlline]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/img/sqlline1.png)
4. Enter the username, `admin`, and password, also `admin` when prompted.
   The `0: jdbc:drill:zk=local>` prompt appears.
At this point, you can [run queries]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/drill-in-10-minutes#query-sample-data).

## Stopping Drill

Issue the following command when you want to exit the Drill shell:

    !quit

## Query Sample Data

Your Drill installation includes a `sample-data` directory with JSON and
Parquet files that you can query. The local file system on your machine is
configured as the `dfs` storage plugin instance by default when you install
Drill in embedded mode. For more information about storage plugin
configuration, refer to [Storage Plugin Registration]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/connect-a-data-source-introduction).

Use SQL syntax to query the sample `JSON` and `Parquet` files in the `sample-data` directory on your local file system.

### Querying a JSON File

A sample JSON file, `employee.json`, contains fictitious employee data.
NOTE TO DOC WRITERS: This sample query works, but I can't find the sample
employee data in the installation (nor the storage plugin configuration file,
which would point me in the right direction). Just like the Parquet example
below, I'm sure people will want to know where this is coming from (in order to
examine the source data themselves).

To view the data in the `employee.json` file, submit the following SQL query
to Drill:

    0: jdbc:drill:zk=local> SELECT * FROM cp.`employee.json` LIMIT 3;

The query output is:

    +--------------+------------------+-------------+------------+--------------+---------------------+-----------+----------------+-------------+------------------------+----------+----------------+------------------+-----------------+---------+--------------------+

### Querying a Parquet File

Query the `region.parquet` and `nation.parquet` files in the `sample-data`
directory on your local file system.

#### Region File

To view the data in the `region.parquet` file, issue the following query:

{% include startnote.html %}When you enter the query, you will need to include
the directory where you installed Drill, and the version of Drill that you installed in the angle-bracketed locations.{% include endnote.html %}

* Linux or Mac OS X

        SELECT * FROM dfs.`<path-to-installation>/apache-drill-<version>/sample-data/region.parquet`;

* Windows

        SELECT * FROM dfs.`<path-to-installation>\apache-drill-<version>\sample-data\region.parquet`;

The query returns the following results:

    +--------------+--------------+-----------------------+
    | R_REGIONKEY  |    R_NAME    |       R_COMMENT       |
    +--------------+--------------+-----------------------+

    | 4            | MIDDLE EAST  | uickly special accou  |
    +--------------+--------------+-----------------------+
    5 rows selected (0.409 seconds)

#### Nation File

{% include startnote.html %}As above, you need to substitute your installation path and the Drill version in the angle-bracketed locations when you enter the query.{% include endnote.html %}

To view the data in the `nation.parquet` file, issue the query appropriate for
your operating system:

* Linux or Mac OS X

          SELECT * FROM dfs.`<path-to-installation>/apache-drill-<version>/sample-data/nation.parquet`;

* Windows

          SELECT * FROM dfs.`<path-to-installation>\apache-drill-<version>\sample-data\nation.parquet`;

The query returns the following results:

    SELECT * FROM dfs.`Users/khahn/drill/apache-drill-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT/sample-data/nation.parquet`;
